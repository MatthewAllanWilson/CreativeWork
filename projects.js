      title: 'The Virgins',
      body: '<p>This is a feature film I wrote, directed, produced and edited. It is a comedy about a young couple who saved themselves for marriage, even though they will only have one night together before the groom leaves for the army.  That night they accidentally lock themselves out of their honeymoon cabin and end up on a wild adventure.  All they want is to consummate their marriage in peace but one circumstance after another interrupts them.  A comedy about waiting and waiting and waiting some more.</p> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aO34JCZbUjE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>You can watch the full movie on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Virgins-Blake-Webb/dp/B00N2E8YWC/" class="link" target="_blank">Amazon</a> or <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-virgins/id891943379" class="link" target="_blank">iTunes</a>.</p> <p>I was fortunate enough to have several media outlets write about the film:<ul><li><a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2014/july-web-only/virgins-are-on-their-way-.html" class="link" target="_blank">Christianity Today</a></li><li><a href="http://convergemagazine.com/virgins-movie-shouldnt-abstain-watching-14020/" class="link" target="_blank">Converge Magazine</a></li><li><a href="http://christandpopculture.com/sex-marriage-prosperity-sex-gospel-review-virgins/" class="link" target="_blank"> Christ and Pop Culture</a></li><li><a href="http://www.roguecinema.com/the-virgins-2014-by-philip-smolen.html" class="link" target="_blank">Rogue Cinema</a></li><li><a href="http://www.hollywoodjesus.com/the-virgins/" class="link" target="_blank">HJ Live!</a></li><li><a href="http://bit.ly/Matt_Wilson_Backstage" class="link" target="_blank">Backstage</a></li></ul></p><p>I also wrote a blog about why I wanted to make this particular film that I am giving myself permission to repost here:</p><p>"IS THIS ONE OF THOSE STUPID CHRISTIAN MOVIES?"</p><p>I was a film student at Biola University when "The Omega Code" came out.  Since it was a Christian school we were able to arrange a special screening of the film and some of the producers came for Q&A after.  I was excited going in.  I had grown up on movies, and now, for the first time ever, I could talk to people who had actually made one.  So I watched it.  And I was appalled.  What a terrible movie!  The only question I had afterwards was, "What were you thinking?!"</p><p>To be fair, the producers were honest and self-deprecating and admitted it hadn\'t quite turned out like they hoped.  But my feeling of disappointment remained.  And when the film was released the feeling was shared by young believers across the nation (and reinforced with many other equally-bad Christian films).  What an embarrassment!  This makes us look so uncool!  And just like that, a generation of young Christians were inspired to have nothing to do with Christian films.</p><p>So I went off to Hollywood with a desire to make real movies.  Movies that would entertain people, just like the movies I loved growing up had entertained me (none of which were Christian movies).  And oh, how surprised the world would be when they learned a Christian had made them!  All I had to do was make big Hollywood movies that achieved overwhelming commercial and critical success and then my shame would be left behind.</p><p>And I wasn\'t alone.  I met many fellow believers in the industry, and none of them had any interest in making Christian films.</p><p>Years went by.  I wrote script after script, worked day jobs in the industry, and did everything I could to achieve success.  I got some great gigs like writing for cartoons and the Warner Brothers Comedy Writers Workshop, and I was even "discovered" by the same producer who "discovered" Diablo Cody and got Juno made.  But something was still missing.  While everyone said my screenplays were well-written, no one was buying them.  I wasn\'t making movies like I hoped.</p><p>I always had in the back of my mind that one day, when I was cool enough to do whatever I wanted, I would put Christian characters in my movies.  And they wouldn\'t be portrayed the way Christians in film had been portrayed before, where in the mainstream films they\'re idiots and in the Christian films they\'re saints.  They would just be real Christians like people I actually knew.</p><p>But that had to wait.  I had to prove I was cool first.</p><p>So I went back to writing screenplays that did not sell.  After each failure I would do a post-mortem and try to figure out what I could do better next time.  The advice I got was consistent - Find your voice.  Write what you know.  Write what you\'re passionate about.  Well, the more I went through life, the more passionate I was about Jesus.  If it were not for my faith in Christ, I would have been completely overwhelmed and broken by all the rejection I was experiencing.  And that got me back to thinking about writing Christian characters.</p><p>But I couldn\'t do that because that\'s not cool!  Christian movies are not cool!</p><p>It became clear after awhile that I had to admit I was not cool.  And I never would be.  I can\'t bash Kirk Cameron movies in good conscience without admitting I have much in common with Kirk Cameron.  I believe the Bible.  I follow Jesus.  I believe we all need Him.  The only subject I can think of where I would strongly disagree with Kirk Cameron is, "Is it a good choice to cast Kirk Cameron?"</p><p>So there I was, a man coming to terms with his uncoolness and accepting it for what it was.  But now I could finally write like me.  I didn\'t have to wait to be cool anymore.  I could write a story that was consistent with how I viewed the world, and not have to worry about whether it was consistent with the way others viewed the world.  In the same way that Woody Allen writes authentically from his atheism, I could write authentically from my Christianity.  And I wasn\'t inspired to do this because I hated Woody Allen films, I was inspired to do this because I loved them.</p><p>I had been sitting on a story idea for a long time about a Christian couple who wait for marriage to have sex and then circumstances on their wedding night keep them waiting.  It always seemed like one of my better movie ideas, but I had resisted writing it in part because I was still single and didn\'t think I should write about a wedding night until I had one of my own.  If I was having amazing sex with my hot wife then I would be cool enough to write a story about what it\'s like to wait.  Because that story has a happy ending.  But that wasn\'t my experience.  At this point I was now in my 30\'s.  I was still waiting, and it was no fun.  I was doing all the right things (as far as I could see), but everything was going wrong.</p><p>And then I realized that is what this story should be about - chasing a dream that dangles in front of you but is always just out of reach.  Because that experience is real.  What is it like when God doesn\'t give you what you want, even when you are trying to honor Him?  That would resonate with people.  And not only would it be real, it would be funny.  As the old Mel Brooks saying goes, "Tragedy is when I cut my finger.  Comedy is when you fall into an open sewer and die."  I knew if I could properly channel the pain I had experienced, others would find it funny.</p><p>So that is exactly what I did.  And it is now with great pride that I present to the world my movie "The Virgins."  It is without a doubt the most uncool thing I\'ve ever done, and I hope to do many more uncool things just like it.</p><p>Is it a Christian movie?  I don\'t know.  But it\'s definitely a comedy.  Was it made by a company that makes Christian movies?  No.  But it was made by a Christian.  An uncool, unmarried Christian who has had many terrible experiences that, by God\'s grace, have been great inspiration for comedy.</p>',

The story concerns a modern day Scrooge who kidnaps Santa Claus in an attempt to take over his toy business, but the FBI finds out and goes after him. His assistant, Bonnie Cratchit, agrees to help him escape, but only if he helps Santa get back to the North Pole first. Now Scrooge, with some help from the Ghosts of Past, Present, and Future, must go on an adventure to bring Santa home in time to save Christmas.</p><img src="images/S&S-cover-02.jpg" class="body-image">  <p>I had always loved Christmas movies, but had been disappointed by the output of recent decades.  The only good one was Elf.  The rest were all copies of the classics (A Christmas Carol, Miracle on 34th St, It\'s a Wonderful Life, etc), so I decided to write a story that borrowed characters from classic Christmas tales and mashed them up into a new adventure with genuine surprises.</p><img src="images/S&S-page-04.jpg" class="body-image">  <p>The reviews were great (<a href="http://www.geeksofdoom.com/2012/10/18/comic-review-scrooge-and-santa" class="link" target="_blank">Geeks of Doom</a>, <a href="http://noflyingnotights.com/2011/12/25/scrooge-and-santa/" class="link" target="_blank">No Flying No Tights</a>), and we were also interviewed for <a href="http://robot6.comicbookresources.com/2011/12/a-scrooge-and-santa-qa/" class="link" target="_blank"> Robot 6</a>, but the most rewarding experience was talking to fans at Comic-Con.

      body: '<p>This was my second \'test movie\' for the Amazon Studios system. The story concerns a young man who can never find the right words to tell the woman he loves how he feels. So one day, at a wishing well, he wishes he could speak like a poet. The next day he gets his wish. But now everything he says rhymes. He cannot stop rhyming! The woman rejects him. His boss fires him. No one understands why he would talk like that.

And I was anxious to apply techniques I learned from making The Umpire a few months prior.  I think it showed great improvement over The Umpire, but unfortunately it didn\'t win any of Amazon\'s contests and therefore didn\'t get as much attention or views.  It was still a great learning experience, though.  And I\'m grateful to all the actors who put their time and energy into the project without getting paid.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L73JFxyZlco" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>You can watch the full movie on <a href="https://youtu.be/L73JFxyZlco" class="link" target="_blank"> YouTube</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Speak-Me-Poetry-Greg-Barnett/dp/B01GW5Q3YI/" class="link" target="_blank">Amazon Instant Video</a>, or the original <a href="http://studios.amazon.com/movies/12577" class="link" target="_blank">Amazon Studios</a> page.</p>',

My reponse was \'what\'s copy\'? But once I tried my hand at it I found that I enjoyed it. The challenge of boiling down a film to one catchy sentence was in the realm of storytelling.</p><img src="images/CroodsLine.jpg" class="big-image"><p class="tagline">"Meet the first modern family."</p>  <p>My favorite line I came up with was for a movie called \'Not Easily Broken\'.  Not so much for the line itself, but because of the circumstances under which it was created. It was late in the day on a Friday and I was on my way to see a movie with some friends when a design firm called me in a panic. They had to submit some mockups to the studio right away but had no taglines. They described the movie to me over the phone and I told them I\'d see what I could do.</p><p> Ten minutes later I called them with a few ideas. One of them was \'Life tries to break you. Love holds you together.\' It ended up being not only the one they used to submit to the studio, but the actual line the studio picked for the key art. Normally these assignments go on for a week or two and I submit dozens of lines, so getting one in ten minutes was a good feeling! I only wish I could do that every ten minutes.</p><img src="images/not_easily_broken.jpg" class="body-image"><p class="tagline">"Life tries to break you.

So some people around the WB office were wondering why Alan would want to hire someone who had so openly criticized his shows.

It\'s also amusing to look back on them now because they\'re based on headlines from the mid-2000\'s. Here\'s a few I\'m not totally embarrassed by:</p><p>Disgraced writer James Frey was invited to appear on the Oprah Winfrey show, where he was then criticized by Oprah for lying in his memoir. Frey plans to write a book about the incident called \'Oprah Loves Me\'.</p><p>It was announced this week that Fabio will no longer be promoting \'I Can\'t Believe It\s Not Butter\'. He finally believes it\'s not butter.</p><p>AOL has announced they are laying off 1300 employees. However, the employees have not yet been notified because the notices were emailed through AOL.</p><p>Kim Jong Ill fired several test missiles into the ocean this week, and is threatening to go to war. In response to the threat, the ocean surrendered.</p><p>Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher were married over the weekend. At the conclusion of the ceremony the minister pronounced them \'boy and wife\'.</p><p>The number of babies born to unwed mothers hit a record high this year.
