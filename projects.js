      title: 'The Virgins',
      body: 'This is a feature film I wrote, directed, produced and edited. It is a comedy about a young couple who have saved themselves for marriage, even though they will only have one night together before the groom leaves for the army.  That night they accidentally lock themselves out of their honeymoon cabin and end up on a wild adventure.  All they want is to consummate their marriage in peace but one circumstance after another interrupts them.  A comedy about waiting and waiting and waiting some more.  Here is the trailer: <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aO34JCZbUjE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br>  I wrote a <a href="http://www.thevirginsmovie.com/blog/is-this-one-of-those-stupid-christian-movies" class="link" target="_blank">blog post</a> about why I wanted to tell this particular story.  The gist was that I wanted to make a Christian movie for people who hate Christian movies.  I have felt for a long time that people of my faith have been inaccurately portrayed in cinema.  Even more so in Christian cinema than the mainstream.  So I tried to do something different.

I loved her illustration style and immediately I thought she should do artwork for the story. <img src="images/Orange_2.jpg">  She hand-painted all the illustrations, which took quite awhile, but the extra work was worth it and in January of 2014 we published a book that we were both quite proud of.

He has a portion of his show where he does \'Weekend Update\' just like he used to on SNL.  I met him through a mutual friend at one of his standup shows and he told me I could pitch him jokes.  I spent hours and hours coming up with dozens and dozens of jokes.  In the end he only used two of them, and I got the impression that he doesn\'t really need a joke writer.  It was just an experiment to see if I could come up with anything better than what he already had.  Even though nothing much came of it, I still think it was a good excercise that helped me develop my writing skills.',
