      title: 'The Virgins',
      body: '<p>This is a feature film I wrote, directed, produced and edited. It is a comedy about a young couple who saved themselves for marriage, even though they will only have one night together before the groom leaves for the army.  That night they accidentally lock themselves out of their honeymoon cabin and end up on a wild adventure.  All they want is to consummate their marriage in peace but one circumstance after another interrupts them.  A comedy about waiting and waiting and waiting some more.  Here\'s the trailer:</p> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aO34JCZbUjE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>I wrote a <a href="http://www.thevirginsmovie.com/blog/is-this-one-of-those-stupid-christian-movies" class="link" target="_blank">blog post</a> about why I wanted to tell this particular story.  The gist was that I wanted to make a Christian movie for people who hate Christian movies.  I have felt for a long time that people of my faith have been inaccurately portrayed in cinema.  Even more so in Christian cinema than the mainstream.  So I tried to do something different.  It got good reviews from both <a href="http://christandpopculture.com/sex-marriage-prosperity-sex-gospel-review-virgins/" class="link" target="_blank"> Christian</a> and <a href="http://www.roguecinema.com/the-virgins-2014-by-philip-smolen.html" class="link" target="_blank"> non-Christian</a> critics.

I loved her illustration style and immediately I thought she should do artwork for the story.</p> <img src="images/Orange_2.jpg">  <p>She hand-painted all the illustrations, which took quite awhile, but the extra work was worth it and in January of 2014 we published a book that we were both quite proud of.

      body: '<p>I teamed up with illustrator Josh Kenfield to turn a Christmas story I wrote into a graphic novel.  </p><img src="images/S&S-cover-02.jpg">  <p>I had always loved Christmas movies, but had been disappointed by the output of recent decades.  The only good one was Elf.  The rest were all copies of the classics (A Christmas Carol, Miracle on 34th St, It\'s a Wonderful Life, etc), so I decided to write a story that borrowed characters from classic Christmas tales and mashed them up into a new adventure with genuine surprises.</p><img src="images/S&S-page-04.jpg">  <p>The reviews were great (<a href="http://www.geeksofdoom.com/2012/10/18/comic-review-scrooge-and-santa" class="link" target="_blank">Geeks of Doom</a>, <a href="http://noflyingnotights.com/2011/12/25/scrooge-and-santa/" class="link" target="_blank">No Flying No Tights</a>), and we were also interviewed for <a href="http://robot6.comicbookresources.com/2011/12/a-scrooge-and-santa-qa/" class="link" target="_blank"> Robot 6</a>, but the most rewarding experience was talking to fans at Comic-Con.  Josh and I had been going to Comic-Con together since we were fresh Biola grads trying to make it in Hollywood, so having a book of our own to sell there was a real treat.</p><img src="images/S&S-page-23.jpg">  <p>The book is available on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Scrooge-Santa-GN-Matthew-Wilson/dp/1897548982/" class="link" target="_blank"> Amazon </a>and <a href="https://www.comixology.com/Scrooge-and-Santa/digital-comic/5337" class="link" target="_blank"> Comixology</a>.</p>',

I think it showed great improvement over The Umpire, but unfortunately it didn\'t win any of Amazon\'s contests and therefore didn\'t get as much attention or views.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L73JFxyZlco" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>It was still a great learning experience, though.

      body: '<p>Occasionally I\'ve been paid to come up with taglines for movie posters.</p><img src="images/takingwoodstock_full.jpg"> <p>One of my roommates in LA was a graphic designer who created movie posters.  He asked me if I would ever be interested in writing copy.  My reponse was \'what\'s copy\'?  But once I tried my hand at it I found that I enjoyed it very much.  The challenge of boiling down a film to one catchy sentence was in the realm of storytelling.</p><img src="images/CroodsLine.jpg">  <p>My favorite line I came up with was for a movie called \'Not Easily Broken\'.  Not so much for the line itself, but because of the circumstances under which it was created.  It was late in the day on a Friday and I was on my way to see a movie with some friends when a design firm called me in a panic.  They had to submit some mockups to the studio right away but had no taglines.  They described the movie to me over the phone and I told them I\'d see what I could do.  Ten minutes later I called them with a few ideas.  One of the lines, \'Life tries to break you.  Love holds you together.\'  It ended up being not only the one they used to submit to the studio, but the actual line the studio picked for the key art.  Normally these assignments go on for a week or two and I submit dozens of lines, so getting one in ten minutes was a good feeling!  I only wish I could do that every ten minutes.</p><img src="images/not_easily_broken.jpg">',

I met him through a mutual friend when I was interested in writing for late night (Letterman, etc), and since he often does \'Weekend Update\' bits just like he used to on SNL he let me send him some pop culture jokes.  I sent him dozens and dozens.  In hindsight, I can see that they were mostly terrible so it\'s no surprise that he only used two of them.  Even though nothing much came of it, I still think it was a good writing excercise.  It\'s also amusing to look back on them now because they\'re based on headlines from the mid-2000\'s.  Here\'s a few that I\'m not totally embarrassed by:</p><p>Disgraced writer James Frey was invited to appear on the Oprah Winfrey show, where he was then criticized by Oprah for lying in his memoir.  Frey plans to write a book about the incident called \'Oprah Loves Me\'.</p><p>Britney Spears is pregnant again.  Kevin Federline wants a girl.  But Britney still wants a man.</p><p>It was announced this week that Fabio will no longer be promoting \'I Can\'t Believe It\s Not Butter\'.  He finally believes it\'s not butter.</p><p>AOL has announced they are laying off 1300 employees.  The employees have not yet been notified because the notices were emailed through AOL.</p><p>Kim Jong Ill fired several test missiles into the ocean this week, and is threatening to go to war.  In response to the threat, the ocean surrendered.</p><p>Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher were married over the weekend.  At the conclusion of the ceremony the minister pronounced them \'boy and wife\'.</p><p>The number of babies born to unwed mothers hit a record high this year.  Experts believe this was because Kevin Nealon was on tour.</p>',
