# CreativeWork
Building a website to showcase the various film and writing projects I've worked on.

Before I started Code Fellows I spent many years in LA trying to make it as a screenwriter.  I worked on several interesting projects and made a few of my own independent films.  I thought building a website to describe all those projects would be a way to self-synergistically showcase my creative work and demonstrate my new coding skills.
